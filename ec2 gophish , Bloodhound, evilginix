Creating a single code to deploy an AWS EC2 instance with Gophish, Evilginx2, BloodHound, and their respective APIs requires a combination of multiple tools and configurations. I'll provide you an outline of the steps to set up an AWS EC2 instance with these tools and APIs:

1. Set up an AWS EC2 instance with the required instance type, security groups, and other configurations.

2. Install the required tools:
   - Gophish: Download and configure Gophish according to the official documentation (https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/installation).
   - Evilginx2: Install Evilginx2 following the instructions on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2).
   - BloodHound: Download and set up BloodHound by following the steps on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).

3. Configure the APIs and integrate them into your application:
   - Gophish API: The Gophish server comes with a RESTful API (https://docs.getgophish.com/api-documentation/). You can use it to interact with the Gophish server programmatically.
   - Evilginx2 API: Evilginx2 does not have a built-in RESTful API. However, you can create a custom wrapper around the CLI tool to interact with it programmatically.
   - BloodHound API: BloodHound uses a Neo4j database to store and query data. You can interact with the data using the Neo4j REST API (https://neo4j.com/docs/http-api/current/) or drivers (https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/4.4/client-applications/).

4. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle multiple services running on different ports.

5. Configure each service and ensure they are running correctly.

Given the complexity of the setup you're looking for, I recommend consulting documentation for each tool and breaking down the process into smaller tasks. Additionally, consider security best practices when deploying these services, especially if they will be exposed to the internet.

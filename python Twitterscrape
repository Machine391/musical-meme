Creating a complete code solution for the tasks mentioned in the report would require extensive development and collaboration with experts in the field. However, I can provide you with a high-level outline of how you might approach building some components of such a system using Python.

1. Import necessary libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import tweepy
import json
import elasticsearch
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
```

2. Configure ChatGPT API access (assuming you have API access):
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

def chat_gpt_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

3. Extract keywords related to human trafficking:
```python
keywords = ["human trafficking", "forced labor", "sex trafficking", "child labor", "debt bondage", "grooming", "recruitment"]

def identify_keywords(text):
    matched_keywords = []
    for keyword in keywords:
        if keyword.lower() in text.lower():
            matched_keywords.append(keyword)
    return matched_keywords
```

4. Twitter API setup and monitoring (assuming you have Twitter API access):
```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

class MyStreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
    def on_status(self, status):
        text = status.text
        matched_keywords = identify_keywords(text)
        if matched_keywords:
            gpt_response = chat_gpt_response(text)
            # Do something with the response, e.g., store in Elasticsearch or alert authorities

myStreamListener = MyStreamListener()
myStream = tweepy.Stream(auth=api.auth, listener=myStreamListener)
myStream.filter(track=keywords)
```

5. Elasticsearch setup and indexing:
```python
es = Elasticsearch([{"host": "localhost", "port": 9200}])

def index_data(data, index_name):
    es.index(index=index_name, body=data)
```

6. Utilizing Social Mapper would require a custom solution, as it is a standalone tool. You can use the output from Social Mapper and integrate it with ChatGPT and Elasticsearch using Python scripts.

Please note that the code snippets provided are just a starting point and require significant development to create a comprehensive and functional solution. Ensure you have the necessary API access and follow the guidelines and policies of the respective platforms.
